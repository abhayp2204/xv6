# XV6 Operating System Extension

Enhanced the existing XV6 Operating System, showcasing expertise in prominent operating system domains including scheduling algorithms and system calls.

## Features

### 1. New System Calls

Extended the XV6 operating system with new system calls to enable user monitoring of processes. This includes functionality to gather information about running processes, their states, and resource utilization.



### 2. Scheduling Algorithms

Implemented and tested new scheduling algorithms to enhance the performance of the operating system. The introduced scheduling algorithms include:

- **Priority-Based Scheduling:** Assigns priority levels to processes, allowing higher-priority processes to be scheduled before lower-priority ones.
  
- **Multi-level Feedback Scheduling:** Utilizes multiple queues with different priorities, allowing processes to move between queues based on their behavior.

- **First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) Queue Scheduling:** Schedules processes in the order they arrive, ensuring fairness in execution.
